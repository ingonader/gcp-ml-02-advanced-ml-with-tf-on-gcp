# # An RNN model for temperature data
# This time we will be working with real data: daily (Tmin, Tmax) temperature series from 36 weather stations spanning 50 years. It is to be noted that a pretty good predictor model already exists for temperatures: the average of temperatures on the same day of the year in N previous years. It is not clear if RNNs can do better but we will se how far they can go.
